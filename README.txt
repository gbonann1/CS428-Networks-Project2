to run
./dissector <sample1.pcap>

Displays all the proper info like good-dissector with the exception of the time. 

Time is displayed as 'arrival time' rather than time since first packet arrival. (current - first)

Source Address, Destination Address, Source IP, Source Port, Destination IP, Destination Port, and IP length should all display accurately.
